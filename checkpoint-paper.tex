\begin{abstract}
Reversal of transactions due to blockchain ledger reorganization has become a major hindrance for public blockchain technologies adoption in real-world business and financial applications. Since a typical real-world product, service, or agreement cannot be backtracked; associated transactions in the blockchain ledger must also be final. This paper describes and analyzes the transaction finality solution for our proof of work (PoW) blockchain network, the Kona Blockchain Platform. Although designed for our specific platform, the ideas from the solution can be easilly adapted to achieve transaction finality in existing public blockchain networks. This paper also discusses how this can be done. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first solution for transaction finality for blockchain networks incentivised exclusively by PoW mining.

\section{Problem Modeling}
\label{s-model}
From the discussion of Section \ref{s-incentive}, we understand that the goal of the checkpoint protocol is to achieve a network-wide consensus about an irreversible and unique state of the blockchain ledger at deterministic intervals. We also understand that at the end of a checkpoint interval, there might be many miners holding different blockchain ledgers that are valid candidates to be the next checkpoint and many who are lagging behind. If we call the formers, \textit{Front-runners}, the qualitative goal of the checkpoint protocol should be as follows:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Fairly select} a single ledger version from the front-runners \textbf{without censoring} the lagging behind miners and ensure \textbf{unaffected progression} of PoW block mining after the selection.  
\end{quote}

Our approach to the highlighed objectives is to establish each checkpoint based on a $51\%$ majority voting by the currently active network peers on front-runners' chains who reached the checkpoint candidacy state the earliest. The evidence of checkpoint selection is included in the winning chain as a checkpoint block and the proceeds for mining the checkpoint block is distributed to the peers voted to supported it. Here a balot is casted for a candidate by solving PoW puzzles on its chain state.
