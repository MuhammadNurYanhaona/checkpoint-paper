\section{The Case for PoW Incentive}
\label{s-incentive}
From a technical perspective, Nakamoto's Bitcoin \cite{bitcoin} took the world by storm because it shows for the first time that a highly secure distributed system can be built from laissez-faire collaboration of a network of mutually-distrusted autonomous peers. Even continuous network connectivity among the peers are not guaranteed with the network-wide connection topology being dynamic. He deemed a PoW for block mining necessary to thwart traditional networking attacks such as the Sybil Attack \cite{Douceur:2002:SA:646334.687813} on such a system. To successfully alter a shared blockchain ledger of honest miners, an attacker has to surpass their combined mining power to construct an alternative chain that is longer; then offer it to them for synchronization. The attempt become more futile as the population of honest peers increases.

The strength of information security in a blockchain network is proportional to the mining capacity of its honest peers. Therefore, keeping honest peers interested in network participation is a central concern in blockchain technology. Nakamoto's ingeneous idea was to make participation in block mining process an economic activity \cite{Kroll2013TheEO} by rewarding a block miner for his/her PoW in terms of transaction fees and a block reward.
