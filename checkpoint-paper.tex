\begin{abstract}
Reversal of transactions due to blockchain ledger reorganization has become a major hindrance for public blockchain technologies' adoption in real-world business and financial applications. Since a typical real-world product, service, or agreement cannot be backtracked; associated transactions in the blockchain ledger must also be final. This paper describes and analyzes the transaction finality solution for our proof of work (PoW) blockchain network, the Kona Blockchain Platform. The solution works even if 49\% of the network's total mining power is compromised due to malicious attacks. Although designed for our specific platform, the ideas from the solution can be easily adapted to achieve transaction finality in existing public blockchain networks. This paper also discusses how this can be done. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first solution for deterministic transaction finality for blockchain networks incentivised exclusively by PoW mining.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{s-conclusion}
Transaction finality guarantee for blockchain ledger is important for blockchain technology's adoption in recording and enforcing real world financial and business matters where actions are seldom reversible. This paper presented our transaction finality solution for the \textit{KONA blockchain network:} a proof of work (PoW) mining based public blockchain network with smart contract support and authorized mining nodes. We provide transaction finality by establishing network-wide consensus about an irreversible ledger state -- we call a \textit{checkpoint} -- at deterministic intervals. The consequent transaction finality protocol is called the \textit{checkpoint protocol}.   

We introduced a notion of a distributed support service in the blockchain network that is responsible for recording heartbeat messages from the active mining peers for population estimation and for tracking the progress of the checkpoint establishment process. A network-wide consensus about a checkpoint is reached by a $51\%$ majority voting on a fair ledger election process by the active mining population and recorded through their heartbeat message exchanges with the support service. The nature of interactions with the support service ensures that mining peers know about the global state of the network within a bounded time and no broadcast is needed for a consensus establishment. 

Apart from presenting our checkpoint protocol, this paper discussed the propriety of our protocol design, its theoretical soundness (in particular, its convergence characteristic), and some protocol related implementation concerns.
      
\subsection{Future Work}
Like any other research, there are rooms for improvement in our work. First, in the worst case, each checkpoint establishment process requires as many voting rounds as there are miners in the network with each rounds requiring significant time. Reducing both the number of rounds and the time span of individual rounds will greatly improve the performance of the checkpoint protocol. Then checkpoints can be established quite frequently without noticeably hampering the normal block mining process. The most challenging improvement is, however, to eliminate the support service nodes altogether and modify the PoW incentive of the mining nodes in such a manner that mining nodes can change their network connectivity and participation behavior at periodic intervals to establish checkpoints on their own. We encourage interested researchers to investigate these prospective improvements.
